# GasCalculatorApp
The application allows you to add records for every refueling. The data is automatically loaded if the file named GasData.xls is found in the working directory. If not, you can open the file from another location using the open button. You can delete selected records using the delete button. The results can be saved. The application calculates how much money we spent on refueling and how much we saved by refueling lpg compared to petrol. Gas Efficiency is the ratio of gas efficiency to petrol by default set to 80%, can be changed using the slider.

The application is not yet immune to errors, e.g. wrong entries entered. This plans to improve and add charts of fuel consumption from time and total savings amounts from all records.
